# IVA Bias Project

## Project Overview  
This project investigates bias in deep learning models by applying **Independent Vector Analysis (IVA)**.  
We focus on identifying hidden patterns in datasets that relate to race, gender, and fairness.  

## Goals  
- Collect and organize benchmark datasets (tabular, vision, NLP).  
- Explore and analyze bias signals in these datasets.  
- Train models using IVA to better understand and detect bias.  
- Share results in a transparent and reproducible way.
